# GLife v.3

GLife is a cellular automata platform based on WebGL2.
- Universal logic: represents both Conway's Game of Life and Langton's Ant as particular examples
- 2D/3D: multi-layer grids
- Cross-platfom
- Insanely fast: GPU is ~1000 times faster than CPU due to parallel computing

It's primary target is the search of artificial life â€” evolving self-repairing self-replicating structures.
